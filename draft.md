# Hi there!

You've succesfully made a pull request! Here are some steps to do while waiting for a maintainer to review the pull request:

1. Check if the checks have failed or passed. You should see the status at the bottom of the pull request or a icon next to the commit ID.
2. Check if the filename, file format and records are valid. If you don't know if it's valid, please read [this part](https://docs.is-a.dev/domain-structure) of the documentation and use a json validator/formator, like [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com). Make sure the file is also in the `domains` directory and not somewhere else.
3. Please make sure you've filled out the pull request template. It is generally not a good idea to overwrite the pull request template with something else unless you know what you are doing. Make sure to add either a publicly available preview of your website or a screenshot of it.
4. Please wait patiently. Pull requests may take between a couple hours to 3 days. All of the maintainer team are volunteers and try to review the pull requests in their spare time. If you want a chance of getting your pull request merged faster then send your pull request number **once** in the `#pull-requests` channel in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/is-a-dev-830872854677422150) and wait patiently.
